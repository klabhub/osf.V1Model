# A recurrent network model of primary visual cortex

The **code/** folder of this repository contains a Matlab implementation of the V1 Ring model. 
This model builds on the work of Sommers, Carandini, Ringach, and Teich and Qian. 


We used this model in two published papers to help understand the role of recurrent connections in adaptation:

1. Quiroga M del M, Morris AP, Krekelberg B. Adaptation without plasticity. Cell Rep. 2016;17:58–68. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.089

2. Quiroga M del M, Morris AP, Krekelberg B. Short-Term Attractive Tilt Aftereffects Predicted by a Recurrent Network Model of Primary Visual Cortex. Front. Syst. Neurosci.2019;13:1–14. https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00067/full

PDFs of these papers are available in the **docs/** folder. 

While there is no manual, the papers give the background, and the quiroga*.m scripts in the **code/** folder show how to reproduce some of the figures
in the papers. 

We continue to use and improve this model to understand how recurrent connections contribute to the complex dynamic responses of visual areas. 
If you want to contribute to the development of this model, please fork the repository and send pull-requests with bug-fixes or additions.
